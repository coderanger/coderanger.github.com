Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork, [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/holman), and post your own compelling blog posts. Because sharing is caring. We're developers, after all.

That said, if you're going to fork away, tip o' the hat if you at least change the styles up a bit. Because design is about being original. We're designers, after all.

Cheers!

- Zach
